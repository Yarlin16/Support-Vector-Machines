The project "Transportation Mode Detection" aims to identify the primary mode of transport used by an individual based on sensor data collected from their smartphone and surrounding environmental variables. This detection is performed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a machine learning technique capable of distinguishing between different classes of data.

Through the utilization of sensors embedded within smartphones, such as GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, along with environmental variables like time of day, weather conditions, and traffic density, the project aims to analyze patterns and features associated with various transportation modes. These modes typically include walking, running, cycling, driving, or using public transportation.

The SVM algorithm is chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex and nonlinear relationships within data. By training the SVM model on labeled datasets comprising sensor readings and corresponding transportation modes, the system can learn to classify new sensor data accurately. This classification capability is vital for applications such as fitness tracking, transportation planning, and urban mobility studies.

In summary, the project leverages sensor data from smartphones and environmental variables to detect an individual's transportation mode using the robust classification capabilities of Support Vector Machines. This approach contributes to enhancing our understanding of human mobility patterns and enables the development of intelligent transportation systems with practical applications in various domains.
